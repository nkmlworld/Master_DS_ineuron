        "Choosing the value of 'K' in K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a critical step that directly impacts the model's performance. Here's a short guide on how to select the value of 'K':\n",
        "\n",
        "Odd Values: When dealing with binary classification problems, it's generally a good practice to choose an odd value for 'K'. This helps avoid ties when voting for the class label of a new data point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm for different values of 'K'. Split your data into training and validation sets, and test the model's accuracy with various 'K' values. Choose the one that gives the best performance on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rule of Thumb: A common rule of thumb is to set 'K' to the square root of the number of data points in the training set. However, this is not a strict rule and might not always yield the best results. It's a good starting point for exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Domain Knowledge: Consider the nature of your dataset and the problem domain. Some datasets might benefit from smaller values of 'K' (e.g., when dealing with noisy data), while others might perform better with larger values of 'K'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grid Search: For more systematic exploration, you can perform a grid search over a range of 'K' values. This involves training and evaluating the model for each 'K' value within the specified range and selecting the one with the best performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that the choice of 'K' can significantly impact the bias-variance trade-off of the model. Smaller values of 'K' tend to increase the model's complexity (lower bias, higher variance), while larger values of 'K' lead to simpler models (higher bias, lower variance). Therefore, it's crucial to strike a balance based on your specific dataset and requirements.\n",

        "F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall.\n",

        "ROC Curve and AUC: For binary classification, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

        "Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It gives an indication of the average magnitude of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE calculates the average of the squares of the differences between the predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of the MSE, providing a measure of the average magnitude of error in the same units as the target variable.\n",

This happens because, in high-dimensional spaces, the distance between data points becomes less meaningful, leading to sparse data and increased computational complexity. As a result, the effectiveness of KNN diminishes, and it becomes challenging to distinguish between nearest and distant neighbors accurately."

        "KNN Imputation: KNN itself can be used to impute missing values. In this approach, missing values are treated as additional variables, and the algorithm calculates the distance between instances based on available values. The missing values are then replaced with the average (or weighted average) of the values from the nearest neighbors.\n",
